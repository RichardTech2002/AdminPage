        <p id="ThisOne">The firm was established in 1938. The firm comprises 17 partners, all of whom are Kenyan citizens. There are fifteen partners in the Commercial Department and seven partners practice in our Dispute Resolution Department, supported by a team of over 40 associates. A number of interns and paralegal staff make up our full complement. This makes us the largest legal practice in East Africa.
            Our clients are private and public companies from Kenya and abroad, local and international banks, development finance agencies and non-government organisations in all sectors of the economy.
            We advise on business law, corporate finance and capital markets, project finance, financial services, banking, power, telecommunications law, infrastructure, transport, manufacturing, tourism, agriculture, and horticulture.
            We represent clients in litigation and provide dispute resolution advice in all of these areas. The firm also works as Kenyan counsel for many international law firms and their clients mainly from Europe, North America, Asia and South Africa.
            To meet the expectations of our clients we have arranged our practice so as to provide teams of lawyers for large-scale transactions when needed. Our transaction teams are led by experienced partners who stay closely involved in all aspects of the matter.
            In addition to being Kenyan advocates, Kaplan & Stratton provides notary and commissioner services. A number of our lawyers are English trained, having gained experience as barristers or solicitors before coming to Kenya. With Kenya’s commercial laws drawing on laws from Commonwealth jurisdictions, and particularly the English system, there is a distinct advantage in having dual-qualified partners and associates in the practice.
            Kaplan & Stratton is a founder member of Lex-Africa, a leading network of independent law firms spanning 28 African countries.  
            Our objective is to provide high quality legal and commercial advice through an efficiently managed professional practice that will facilitate our clients’ business dealings in Kenya and elsewhere in the East African region.<br><br>
